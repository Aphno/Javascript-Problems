# Javascript-Problems
Solves the following in Javascript Language
Programming Logic Assignment

Objective: Solve the following programming problems using the programming language of your choice (e.g., PHP, Python, JavaScript, C++, C# etc.). Each problem should be solved in a separate function.

Problem 1: Reverse a String
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

Problem 2: Find the Largest Number
Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the largest number in the array.

Problem 3: Fibonacci Sequence
Write a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The function should return an array containing the sequence.

Problem 4: Check for Palindrome
Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). The function should return a boolean (true if it's a palindrome, false if it's not).

Problem 5: Factorial Calculation
Write a function that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.

Problem 6: Prime Number Checker
Write a function that checks if a given positive integer is a prime number. The function should return a boolean (true if it's prime, false if it's not).

Problem 7: Count Words in a String
Write a function that counts the number of words in a given string. Words are separated by spaces or punctuation marks.

Problem 8: Sorting Algorithm
Implement a basic sorting algorithm of your choice (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort) to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

Problem 9: Find Common Elements
Write a function that takes two arrays as input and returns an array containing elements that are common to both input arrays.

Problem 10: Calculate the Power
Write a function that calculates the result of raising a given base to a specified exponent (both are positive integers).
